# Reflections for M2

At this stage, our dashboard has successfully implemented all the functionalities we initially set out to include:

## Implemented Features

- **Sales Data Aggregation**: Gathers extensive sales data to offer a comprehensive overview of sales performance.
- **Best-selling Products Identification**: Analyzes sales data to spotlight popular products by sales volume.
- **Customer Geographic Distribution Visualization**: Maps customer locations globally, aiding in the analysis of sales data by country/region.
- **Sales Trend Analysis**: Displays sales trends to highlight changes in market dynamics and consumer behavior.
- **RFM Model Integration**: Incorporates the Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) model for accurate customer segmentation.

## Areas for Improvement

However, there are several areas where our dashboard can be improved:

- **User Experience**: On page two, we've observed that users experience noticeable lag, which requires optimization. Additionally, the layout needs clearer separation of functional areas to allow users to easily identify and use the features they need, reducing confusion.
- **Inconsistencies in Sales Trend Analysis**: The bar chart for monthly sales trends on Page 2 shows some inconsistencies (e.g., the x-axis might display January 2011, but hovering over a bar shows December 31st), which may confuse users.
- **Dashboard Theme and Color Scheme**: The overall appearance of the dashboard needs enhancement to look more professional.
- **Reassessing Customer Needs**: As our final step, it's essential to revisit our original scenario and prototype to guarantee that our dashboard fully satisfies our customers' needs. By conducting a comprehensive review of customer requirements, we can uncover any missed functionalities or design aspects that need refinement. This ensures our dashboard is perfectly aligned with user expectations.

## Next Steps

We are dedicated to addressing these issues in the coming week. Through evaluating different solutions and comprehensive testing, our aim is to refine our dashboard into a professional, streamlined platform that significantly improves user experience.
