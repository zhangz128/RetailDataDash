# Proposal

**Our role:** Data scientist consultancy firm

**Target audience:**  Sales operation department in online retail company

In this dynamic and competitive retail market, understanding data plays an important role in strategic decision-making and optimizing operational efficiency. In order to dig into the potential customers and buying preferences, we propose to build a visualization dashboard of sales data. That includes sales performance with individual transactions, product analysis like most popular products based on quantity sold, and geographical analysis with buyer locations. Through this dashboard, our goal is to improve the sales operation department’s comprehension of market dynamics, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.

**Description of the data:** 

We will visualize a dataset of approximately 54,000 transnational data documented by an online retail company based in the UK. It holds rich transactional records from a renowned non-store online retail company known for selling unique all-occasion gifts. Each transaction has 7 associated variables that identify the transactions (‘InvoiceNo’ that are six-digit integral), five-digit stock code corresponding with specific items within the inventory system (‘StockCode’), details of products per transaction (product names: ‘Description’), the volume of each product (‘Quantity’), how much each unit retails at (‘UnitPrice’), the timestamps of each transaction were generated down (‘InvoiceDate’) and the location of each customer (‘Country’).

**Research questions and usage scenarios:** 

Emily is an e-commerce manager for an online retail company specializing in home and lifestyle products, focusing on online sales strategies and customer relationship management. She understands data visualization tools well but prefers intuitive interfaces that allow for quick insights without needing to write code. Emily aims to increase sales and improve customer retention by understanding customer preferences, identifying best-selling products, and optimizing inventory management. She is also interested in exploring new markets and customer segments to expand the business.

Emily's primary objective with the dataset is to comprehensively understand product sales performance across various countries. This includes identifying which products are bestsellers in each country, a crucial insight that can inform her strategy for inventory management and marketing campaigns. When Emily logs into our app, she will see the dashboard that features "Bestseller Products" prominently. This visualization will display the top-selling products across different countries, complete with filters for Emily to select specific countries of interest. By utilizing these filters, Emily can quickly determine which products are the bestsellers in each country, enabling her to tailor her inventory and marketing strategies accordingly to match local preferences and demand.  And also, our app contains a Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) section, which allows for the precise identification of customers who are most valuable to the business based on their recent purchases, how often they buy, and how much they spend. In this case, Emily can distinguish between high-value and low-value customers, ensuring resources are focused on high-value customers or those with the potential for increased engagement, optimizing the return on investment. This immediate visual insight helps Emily identify her most important customers at a glance, and it also helps Emily develop targeted marketing strategies and personalized engagement plans. Beyond her initial needs, Emily also requires a detailed understanding of sales performance across different countries to devise more accurate strategies for marketing and inventory management. Our app includes a unique map feature that serves this exact purpose. By interacting with the map, Emily can click on any country she wishes to explore, effectively filtering the sales data for that specific country. This design transforms the map from a mere display tool into a dynamic, intuitive filter. By using the map filter, the "Sales Trends" module presents a comprehensive analysis of sales data over time by country. Emily can use this feature to observe how sales volumes for specific countries have evolved across different time frames, and which quarter contributes most to sales. This module will help Emily identify patterns such as growing demand, stagnant sales, declining interest, and seasonal trends of high demand, assisting her in making more accurate predictions about future demand and adjusting her decisions on where to focus expansion efforts or adjust marketing tactics. Furthermore, Emily also seeks to evaluate customer engagement and sales optimization in each country, intending to identify key customers who contribute most significantly to sales. By using our app, the "Customers Segmentation" area will display a pie chart that provides a visual breakdown of customers based on our RFM model, showing the segmentation of different classification of customers.
