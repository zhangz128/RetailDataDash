## Decision Making:

* Majority vote, roundtable discussion to hear everyone’s perspective, then vote. 

* If one of us fixates on a particular idea, we can provide an opportunity for that person to fully articulate their concept and present their case to the rest of the team. It allows for an open forum where the idea can be discussed, challenged, and considered from various perspectives, ensuring that all voices are heard and the best decisions are made collaboratively.
